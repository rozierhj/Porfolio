# Porfolio

## Description

This was the first practice of building and styling and HTML webpage with CSS. The succesful completion of this project required a page that described that contained links to projects I have worked on as well as a link to my resume and other contact information/social media accounts for users reviewing the page to go to. The project was not only an excersize in creating websites with HTML and CSS but also the creation of a page in which I can feature any future work that I have done. 
The HTML page contains links to different sections on the page. It was also a good experience with adding an manipulating images on a webpage, creating a responsive webpage for different screen sizes, practicing with CSS flex and grid properties and simple animation.

## Usage

Here is a [link to the webpage](https://rozierhj.github.io/Challenge.01-Selectors-Semantic_Elements/#search-engine-optimization)


This is what the web page should like like when this challenge is complete.
